I have born at least two decades ago as of today (2024) and raised up just like anybody.

In my childhood, there been a few electronic toy's such as remote car's and the tiny "9999 in 1" tetris toy,
i also had access to keypad phone of my few relatives, which i had play many J2ME game countless times.
The most attractive game to me was "Forgotten Warrior" which i had played on a Samsung SGH-E830.

I have also been watching TV cartoon movies, and i can't count how many title have i watched.
Yet i can say the most attractive movie to me was "Code Lyoko",
A movie with real world and virtual world which you can transfer between through a computer setup,

In fact it is the Jeremie Belpois aka the main character of that movie you just see right on my profile picture.
I can say that movie had initial affect on me to get curious about Desktop setup's, how they work, and what can i do with them in real life.

However i had no access to any internet access nor a Desktop device a decade ago,
I had not been living in an metropolitan town but a village with good neighbourhood relationship.

About my username MrMiy4mo, you might think it is a favourite movie character,
You can indeed find a anime movie called "Chio's School Road" which serves "Chio Miyamo" as the main character,
To be honest it is just a coincidence, i did not even watch any anime movie for real so far.
I was just had thinking for a cool nickname and "MÄ±yamo" was my selection, it is derrivated to MrMiy4mo over times.
It does not have any meaning at all and rather awkward.

I have got my first computer just right when i get accepted to a university about programming branch.
I wish i had it far before, but i don't mind it, it is never late to learn something.

So what now? i have a dream of developing apps for Android devices today, they could be 3D games, or API apps
I need ideas and motivation to get started, and i will to...
